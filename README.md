The EJB standard took a giant step between version 2.1 and 3.0 - the same step (in our eyes) is still missing in the JMS standard (even in [2.0](http://java.net/projects/jms-spec)): To provide a simple to use, POJI business interface solution to remote calls... only asynchronous in this case. Even Spring has not a solution satisfying us, so some people at 1&1 have started this project.

We want to evolve it into a standard in some way (in some fits of megalomania I still think it maybe even become part of JMS 3.0 and/or Java EE 8 one day ;-). As a first step we make it publicly available so everybody can take a look at what we're up to. We welcome any feedback - from feature requests to patches, from downloads to success stories. Yes, downloading is feedback, too: Having lots of users and still no comments could mean that the project is just perfect, couldn't it? ;-)
